As start, sync Cyanogen Mod sources like described on
http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Nexus_One:_Compile_CyanogenMod_%28Linux%29
BE CAREFUL: to reposync CM9 you should pick ics branch instead of gingerbread in command repo init (last param: -b ics instead of -b gingerbread)

When done, copy whole acer folder to [your CM path(recommended android-ics/system on home)]/device.
PREPARING BUILD:
plug in your Metal (make sure that you have latest rom and adb is set up) and fire up extract-files.sh;
then we can continue :)
To build CM, just follow next instruction:
in terminal:
cd [your CM path]
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch cm_a4-userdebug (brunch is broken for us for now..)
make -j[number of cores that you have * 2]

userdebug or higher is recommended to deodex rom.

then, when build is ready, just copy system folder from out/target/product/a4 to dev folder in devicetree.
find (on any cm-based rom for our device) and place META-INF folder and boot.img file to /dev .
change updater-script if necessary on respective file on dev folder
fire up prepare_build.sh to make some cleanups on ready and copied build
zip system with META-INF and boot.img file to make flashable unsigned zip

Note about htc camera:
there is a patcher shell script named HTCcampatch.sh. If you want to try something with htc libcamera, 
apply it first. It will make all necessary changes to sources and set up your tree. 
To return again to stable library, apply HTCcamrevert.sh with two "y" at prompts(needed in patch-revert mechanics)
